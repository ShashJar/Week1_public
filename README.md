# Week1_public

This repository is the PUBLIC repo for students of the 2018 MIT BWSI Medlytics course for WEEK 1.  Most notebooks do not include solutions, and instead has [# Your code here] where students should write their own code.

This repository is a forked copy from the original. It includes the notebooks worked on during Week 1 - Review of General Types of sklearn Algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, etc.).
